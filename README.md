 My HTML Resume Project 🚀

This is a simple, single-page resume website I built for my web development assignment. The main challenge here was to create a professional-looking layout using pure HTML only—absolutely no CSS allowed!

 What’s inside?
I focused on using the right HTML tags to make the resume easy to read and well-structured. Here’s a breakdown of what I included:

* **Header:** My name and a quick tagline about being a developer.
* **About Me:** A short intro about my experience.
* **Skills:** A bulleted list of my tech stack.
* **Experience & Education:** I used HTML tables here to keep the dates and roles organized in rows and columns.
* **Projects:** Detailed sections for my work with sub-points for the tech used.
* **Contact:** All my details at the bottom so people can find me.

 How to view it
Since this is just basic HTML, you don't need to install anything. 
1. Just download the `index.html` file.
2. Double-click it to open it in your favorite browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.).

Parameter,Marks (Out of 20),Reasoning
UI Layout & Structure,18/20,Perfectly follows the requested layout. Uses <hr> effectively to separate sections.
Spacing & Consistency,16/20,"Vertical spacing is clear. The tables are aligned to the left, which is standard for pure HTML."
Visual Clarity,18/20,Very easy to read. Headings are bolded correctly using <h1> through <h3>.
HTML Semantics,16/20,"It uses tables for tabular data (Experience/Education) and lists for skills, which is the ""correct"" way."
Overall Quality,17/20,"Solid work. It is a bit ""plain,"" but that is expected since CSS was forbidden."

Review Summary: Great job on following the "No CSS" constraint. The structure is clean and mirrors the required layout perfectly.

Strengths:

Excellent use of HTML tables for the Experience and Education sections.

Proper hierarchy of headings makes the document easy to scan.

Semantic use of unordered lists for the skills section.

Suggestions for Improvement:

You could use the cellpadding attribute in your tables to add a bit more "breathing room" inside the boxes.

Adding a <footer> tag for the copyright notice at the bottom would improve the HTML semantics even further.

Final Score: 85/100
