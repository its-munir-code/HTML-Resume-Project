 My HTML Resume Project 🚀

This is a simple, single-page resume website I built for my web development assignment. The main challenge here was to create a professional-looking layout using pure HTML only—absolutely no CSS allowed!

 What’s inside?
I focused on using the right HTML tags to make the resume easy to read and well-structured. Here’s a breakdown of what I included:

* **Header:** My name and a quick tagline about being a developer.
* **About Me:** A short intro about my experience.
* **Skills:** A bulleted list of my tech stack.
* **Experience & Education:** I used HTML tables here to keep the dates and roles organized in rows and columns.
* **Projects:** Detailed sections for my work with sub-points for the tech used.
* **Contact:** All my details at the bottom so people can find me.

 How to view it
Since this is just basic HTML, you don't need to install anything. 
1. Just download the `index.html` file.
2. Double-click it to open it in your favorite browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.).

 Evaluation Checklist
